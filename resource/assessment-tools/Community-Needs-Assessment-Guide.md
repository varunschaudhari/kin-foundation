## üîç Introduction

### What is Community Needs Assessment?

Community Needs Assessment is a systematic process of identifying and analyzing the needs, resources, and priorities of a specific community. It helps organizations:

### Key Principles

n = (Z¬≤ √ó p √ó q) / e¬≤
Where:
n = sample size
Z = confidence level (1.96 for 95%)
p = estimated proportion
q = 1-p
e = margin of error
```
